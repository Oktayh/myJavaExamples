 ###  Question of Challange1
 
 You will write a program that determines the type of metal by calculating its
density given its mass, shape, and dimensions. Your program prompts use for the mass (in
gr) and the dimensions of the shape (in cm), respectively. If user enters
  one dimension value, then this shape must be a cube,
  two dimensions, this shape must be a cylinder (assume that the first and second values
  three dimensions, this shape must be a rectangular prism.
First you need to compute the volume of the shape and then the density (p = m/v ). Finally,
density2metal method determines which metal is it given the density value. Note that the
error tolerance is specified as 0.5 in the program (to identify the density of the material).
The density values are given in Lab4.java. If the density is found to be 19.0, this can be
classified as gold because the density of gold is 19.3 and the difierence is within the tolerance
level, i.e., |19.3-19.0| < 0.5.

 ###  Question of Challange4 
  
  you will write a program that tests whether an integer number number consists
of digit pairs whose sum is 10.

A pair of digits is dened as the two digits whose positions are same from left and
right-hand side of a number.

 For example, given n=21798, 2 and 8 are paired with each other: 2 and 8 are the first
digit from left and right-hand side, respectively. Similarly, 1 and 9 are a pair of digits
as well.
